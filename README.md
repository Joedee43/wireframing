## 🔑 Key Elements of a Wireframe

A wireframe is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product. It focuses on structure, user experience, and functionality rather than colors or graphics. Below are the core elements commonly found in wireframes:

---

### 🧱 Layout Structure

Defines the overall arrangement of elements on the screen, such as headers, footers, sidebars, and main content areas.

**Example:**  
A blog layout might include:
- A header for the site title
- A left sidebar for navigation
- A central column for blog content
- A footer for additional links

This structure guides user flow and supports a consistent design.

---

### 🧭 Navigation

Represents menus, buttons, and links that help users move between different pages or sections.

**Example:**  
A top navigation bar with:
- **Home**
- **About**
- **Contact**

This helps users find what they’re looking for quickly and efficiently.

---

### 📝 Content Placement

Specifies where text, images, and videos will appear. It determines the hierarchy and visibility of content on a page.

**Example:**  
A homepage wireframe might feature:
- A hero section with a headline and call-to-action (CTA)
- Featured products or services just below
- Testimonials and footer information at the bottom

Good content placement ensures the most important information is seen first.

---

### ⚙️ Functionality

Outlines interactive elements such as forms, buttons, sliders, and dropdowns. It shows what users can do on the page.

**Example:**  
A login screen may include:
- Input fields for username and password
- A "Login" button
- A "Forgot Password?" link

This illustrates how users will interact with the application.

Each element plays a vital role in shaping user experience, ensuring clarity, usability, and functionality early in the design process.

## 🧱 Types of Wireframes

Wireframes are visual guides that represent the skeletal framework of a digital interface. They help map out the structure and functionality of a page or app before moving into full design and development. Wireframes are commonly categorized by their level of fidelity:

### 🔹 Low-Fidelity Wireframes

- **Purpose**: Used early in the design process to sketch out the layout and user flow quickly.
- **Appearance**: Simple, grayscale designs with boxes and labels to indicate UI elements. No detailed styling or real content.
- **When to Use**: During initial planning or brainstorming sessions to explore layout options.

### 🔹 High-Fidelity Wireframes

- **Purpose**: Detailed representations that closely mimic the final product.
- **Appearance**: Includes real or close-to-real content, images, fonts, branding, colors, icons, and sometimes interactivity.
- **When to Use**: Later in the design process, for stakeholder presentations, user testing, or developer handoff.

## ✨ Wireframe Fidelity Used Here

The Figma screens provided above represent **High-Fidelity Wireframes**.

### ✅ Justification:

- Real content and product imagery are used (e.g., property listings with prices and names).
- Branding elements such as the logo, button styles, and color scheme are applied.
- UI components like input fields, navigation bars, icons, and form controls are detailed and styled.
- The overall interface looks very close to the final product in both structure and aesthetics.

### 📌 Why It Matters:

High-fidelity wireframes are ideal for:
- Showcasing the final user experience.
- Getting accurate feedback from users and stakeholders.
- Supporting developers with a clear and complete design reference.
